This repository aims to group various device plugins by providing unified
handling for common patterns.

## Current Device Plugins

> **Note:** When testing these device plugins ensure to open the feature gate
> using `kubelet`'s `--feature-gates=DevicePlugins=true`

Each plugin may have it's own build instructions in the linked README.md.
